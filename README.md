# ShareScraper

Due to InvestNow having abysmal portfolio tracking, decided to write a scraper to get the current values for a couple of index funds.

Currently retreives the following:

* Australasian Property Index Fund
* Vanguard International Shares Select Exclusions Index Fund
* NZ Shares Index Fund

Have hardcoded a whole bunch of stuff to suit my needs e.g. the fortnightly contribution

Future Ideas/To-Do's

* ~~Turn into an api for ease of use~~
* Make front end 
* Add functionality to retrieve some historical data to make fancy graphs
* Mobile App????
